# Metro ToDo 8


This Readme will still be updated in future releases.

Metro ToDo is a To-Do Application made natively for Windows 8+. The main purpose is to help you have a handy yet simple to-do application for your Windows 8 or 8.1 environtment. The second purpose is to help inspire new or learner programmers to study or create a simple yet useful utility applications.


## Background

It's one of my ToDo series for any operating systems. Now it's my time to make it for Windows 8 series. It developed using a regular WinForms C# application but using Metro Framework UI to make it looks like a Windows 8 app design. I made this in a Windows 8.1 VM for more native experiences.

## Features

It covers basic To Do features just like my other To Do apps. Since it's still in BETA, I will provide final list of features soon.

## Technical Requirements

There are no specific requirements for this application, I believe it will run on Windows 8 and newer machines, so I'll just mention the tools I used to create this application.

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (C# WinForms)
- Microsoft .NET 4.5+

## Application Support and Updates

I'll decide later after the app reaches release version.

## Usage

As stated on the license I chose. Plus you're free to contact me [here](contact@ricardogunawan.com) if you think you want to use my apps for other purposes, or even want to help me making this app better :) . Usage for study purposes and project starters are always welcome.

## Screenshots

Will be updated soon.
